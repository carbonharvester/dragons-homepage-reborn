You're paying $5,000 per student for an international school trip. That's $100,000 for a group of 20. Parents write the cheques. The school stakes its reputation. But ask where that money actually ends up, and most trip providers go quiet.

This isn't an accident. The school trip industry has operated without pricing transparency for decades — and it's communities in Kenya, Ghana, Cambodia, and dozens of other destinations that pay the price.

## The Numbers Nobody Shares

Here's what we know from industry research and our own experience operating in Kenya:

**70%+ of tourism revenue typically leaves the community visited.** It goes to international operators, Western staff, marketing budgets, flights, and overhead in other countries. The community that hosts your students, smiles for photos, and performs gratitude? They might see 10-15% of what you paid.

**Most trip providers don't publish budgets.** Ask for a line-item breakdown before booking — not a price range, an actual breakdown — and watch the response. Some will say it's "commercially sensitive." Others will say they "don't break costs down that way." Both responses mean the same thing: they don't want you to see.

**Fixed "community donations" mask the real picture.** Some providers say "$100 per student goes to community development." Sounds good until you realise that's 2% of a $5,000 trip. Where's the other 98%?

**Seasonal hiring is the norm.** Most trip companies hire local staff for the duration of visits. Between groups, those people have no income. This isn't community development — it's gig work dressed up as partnership.

## Why This Matters for Schools

This isn't just an ethical issue. It's a practical one.

**Parent trust.** When parents can see where their money goes, they're more supportive. When they can't, they're right to be skeptical. The next parent who asks "is this worth $5,000?" deserves a real answer.

**Institutional reputation.** Schools that get caught funding voluntourism face real reputational risk. Media investigations, social media criticism, student activism — the landscape has changed.

**Actual impact.** If you're spending $100,000 to send 20 students somewhere, wouldn't you want to know how much of that reaches the community? The difference between 10% and 70% staying locally is the difference between tourism and impact.

## What Transparency Looks Like

Here's what we share with every school before they book:

**Line-item budget breakdown.** Not ranges. Not estimates. Actual numbers for every cost category: accommodation, transport, meals, community program funding, local staff salaries, equipment, operator margin.

**72% stays in Kenya.** That's our number. It includes Kenyan staff salaries (year-round), local suppliers, community program funding, and locally owned accommodation. We publish it because schools should know it before deciding.

**Year-round staff costs included.** Our community coordinators, garden managers, and program staff are paid every month — not just during visit seasons. Their salaries are part of the trip cost because the trip is funding year-round work.

**Annual impact report.** We publish our [2025 Impact Report](/resources/impact-report) with full program data, financial breakdowns, and goals for the coming year. Not because we have to. Because trip providers should show their work.

## How to Demand Transparency from Any Provider

You don't need to switch providers to benefit from this. You just need to ask better questions:

1. **"Can you share a line-item budget before we commit?"** If no: that's your answer.
2. **"What percentage of our trip cost stays in the local economy?"** If they don't know the number: that's your answer.
3. **"Are local staff employed year-round or hired seasonally?"** Seasonal = the program exists for visitors.
4. **"Do you publish an annual impact or financial report?"** If not: what are they tracking?
5. **"Can I see where our specific group's money went after the trip?"** This is the gold standard. Few providers can do it.

We built a full checklist with "good answers" and "red flags" for these questions and more.

## The Bigger Picture

Pricing transparency isn't just about money. It's about power.

When schools can see where their money goes, they can choose providers that fund communities over operators. When communities can verify what they're receiving, they can hold partners accountable. When parents can see the breakdown, they can make informed decisions.

Opacity serves operators. Transparency serves communities.

If your current trip provider is transparent about pricing — great. Keep working with them. If they're not, ask yourself what they're protecting by keeping the numbers hidden.
