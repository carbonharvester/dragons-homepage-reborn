You're about to spend $3,000-5,000 per student on an international school trip. That's $60,000-150,000+ of parent money, school time, and institutional reputation.

Before you book, ask these seven questions. They won't appear on any provider's FAQ page — and the answers will tell you more than any brochure ever could.

## 1. What happens to the project when our students leave?

This is the most important question on this list. And the one most trip providers hope you never ask.

**Good answer:** "Our programs run year-round with local staff. Student groups visit during scheduled windows and join work that's already happening. Here's a photo from last month — no visiting group was there."

**Red flag:** "We work with local partners who continue the project..." (vague, no specifics). Or: "Each group builds on what the previous group started" (means the project exists for visitors).

**Why it matters:** If the work only happens when students are present, it was designed for students, not communities. The community is a backdrop.

## 2. Can you share a line-item budget for this trip?

Not a price range. Not "approximately." A line-item breakdown showing where every dollar goes.

**Good answer:** "Absolutely. Here's our standard breakdown: X% accommodation, X% transport, X% community programs, X% local staff, X% operator margin. We'll customise it for your group size."

**Red flag:** "Our pricing is competitive for the market" (doesn't answer the question). Or: "We don't break down costs that way" (why not?).

**Why it matters:** If a provider won't tell you where the money goes, parents can't make informed decisions and communities can't verify what they receive.

## 3. Are local community members paid and in leadership roles?

Not "we work with local partners." Specifically: are the people in the community being paid, and are they making decisions?

**Good answer:** "Our Kenya team of 12 are all Kenyan nationals. They're employed year-round with benefits. Community coordinators design program priorities. Here are their names and roles."

**Red flag:** "We hire local guides and translators for each visit" (seasonal, not leadership). Or: "Our experienced Western team manages the programs" (locals are props).

**Why it matters:** If the people who live there aren't leading and being paid fairly, the program serves visitors, not communities.

## 4. Can we speak to a community leader — not just a past school client?

School references tell you about the student experience. Community references tell you about the community impact. Both matter. Most providers only offer the first.

**Good answer:** "Of course. Here's the contact for [name], who leads our [program]. And [name], the head teacher at [school]. They'll give you their honest perspective."

**Red flag:** "We can connect you with several schools who've used our programme" (deflection). Or: "Our community partners prefer not to be contacted directly" (why?).

**Why it matters:** The community's perspective on a program is at least as important as a previous client's. If a provider blocks that conversation, ask why.

## 5. What percentage of our trip cost reaches the local community?

Not "we give back to communities." A number.

**Good answer:** "72% of our revenue stays in Kenya. That includes local staff salaries, community program funding, local suppliers, and accommodation run by community members. Here's the breakdown."

**Red flag:** "A portion of every trip goes to community development" (what portion?). Or: "We donate X amount per student" (a fixed donation regardless of trip cost usually means a small percentage).

**Why it matters:** The industry average for tourism revenue staying in communities is shockingly low. Knowing the number lets you compare providers honestly.

## 6. Do you publish impact data for the community — not just student testimonials?

"97% of students said it was life-changing" is a satisfaction survey, not an impact metric.

**Good answer:** "We publish an annual impact report with community-defined metrics: meals served daily, water access points built, women in cooperatives, school enrollment data. Here's the latest."

**Red flag:** "Our alumni consistently rate their experience highly" (student data, not community data). Or: "We track the impact of each group's contribution" (means impact is attributed to visits, not year-round work).

**Why it matters:** If a provider can't show what changed for the community — with data, not stories — how do they know their programs work?

## 7. What does your organisation do between student visits?

The year-round test. Simple. Devastating.

**Good answer:** "Between visits, our Kenya team runs the same programs: school feeding, water cooperatives, permaculture gardens. We can show you monthly reports. The work doesn't stop."

**Red flag:** "We use the off-season to prepare for upcoming groups" (the program is the trips). Or: "Our local partners maintain the projects" (who? how? with what funding?).

**Why it matters:** This question reveals whether you're funding year-round community work or paying for a two-week production staged for visitors.

## What To Do With These Answers

If your current provider answers all seven questions clearly and specifically — great. You've found a good partner.

If they struggle with two or more — that doesn't mean they're bad people. It means their model wasn't built for community impact. It was built for the student experience. Those are different things.

We built a downloadable version of these questions with expanded benchmarks for each. It's designed to bring to your next vendor meeting.
