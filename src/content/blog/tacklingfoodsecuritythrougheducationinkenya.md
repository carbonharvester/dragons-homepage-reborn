At Kapes Adventures, we believe travel can change the world—one student, one community at a time. Since 2023, our immersive programs in Kenya have transformed unused school land into thriving gardens, providing daily meals to hundreds of local children and creating lasting food security solutions. Through hands-on permaculture projects, we’re addressing a critical social issue: food insecurity in rural Kenyan communities.

## The Challenge of Food Insecurity

In many rural areas of Kenya, like those near Tsavo East, access to consistent, nutritious meals is a daily struggle for children. Limited resources, drought, and economic challenges often mean students go to school hungry, impacting their ability to learn and grow. According to local partners, some schools in these regions struggle to provide even one meal a day, leaving children vulnerable to malnutrition and stunted development. This isn’t just a local issue—it’s a barrier to education and a cycle that perpetuates poverty.

## Our Solution: Food for Education

Our Food for Education Program Trip empowers students to make a tangible difference. During a 5–7 day journey, students work alongside Kenyan children and local experts to transform unused school land into sustainable gardens. Using permaculture techniques, they plant crops like maize, beans, and leafy greens, building agricultural systems that provide ongoing meals for the school. In 2024 alone, our trips funded gardens that now feed over 300 students daily across multiple schools.

But it’s more than just planting seeds—it’s about planting hope. Students collaborate with their Kenyan peers to co-design a mural for the garden, blending symbols of both cultures into a vibrant artwork. This exchange fosters mutual respect, as Kenyan children share their knowledge of local farming, while visiting students bring fresh perspectives and enthusiasm. Together, they create a legacy of nourishment and connection.

## The Impact: Feeding Minds and Futures

The results speak for themselves. One school near Tsavo East now harvests enough crops to provide daily lunches, ensuring children can focus on learning instead of hunger. “The garden changed everything,” said Mary, a local teacher. “Our students are healthier, happier, and more engaged in class.” For the communities, these gardens are a lifeline, ensuring food security even during dry seasons, thanks to sustainable practices like rainwater harvesting.

For our students, the experience is transformative. They return with a deeper understanding of global challenges like food insecurity, along with practical skills in permaculture and a renewed sense of purpose. “I never realized how much a garden could mean to a community,” shared Emma, a 15-year-old participant. “I’m proud to have been part of something so meaningful.”
