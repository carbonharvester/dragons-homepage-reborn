excerpt: "For many families, the cost of school uniforms can be a significant burden, especially for those living in poverty. It's not just a financial burden, but also a barrier to education. School uniforms provide a sense of belonging and equality among students, and not having one can lead to shame and embarrassment. In many countries, children are not allowed to attend school without a uniform. Additionally, studies show that school uniforms can reduce absenteeism and improve academic performance.

For many families, the cost of school uniforms can be a significant burden, especially for those living in poverty. It's not just a financial burden, but also a barrier to education. School uniforms provide a sense of belonging and equality among students, and not having one can lead to shame and embarrassment. In many countries, children are not allowed to attend school without a uniform. Additionally, studies show that school uniforms can reduce absenteeism and improve academic performance. However, not every child has access to a proper uniform, which is where free school uniform programs can make a difference.

**The Positive Impact of Free School Uniforms in Kenya**

Research has demonstrated the positive impact of providing free school uniforms in Kenya. A study by the World Bank found that providing uniforms to children in rural Kenya led to a 12% reduction in absenteeism. Another study by Innovations for Poverty Action found that providing uniforms to primary school students in Kenya led to a 34% increase in school attendance. According to a case study by the Kenyan Ministry of Education in partnership with the World Bank, distributing free school uniforms to primary school children in Kenya led to a 62% reduction in absenteeism. These findings clearly suggest that providing free school uniforms can have a significant impact on the education of children in developing countries. Setting the research aside, I have seen firsthand the positive impact that providing a free school uniform can have during our visit to Kenya in 2022.

**One For All: Kapes' Free School Uniform Program**

At Kapes, we believe that every child should have access to a proper school uniform, regardless of their financial background. This is why we launched our One For All program, in which we provide a free school uniform to a child in need for every uniform child we sell a school uniform to. The first school to benefit from this program, as a result of our partnership with [The Arbor School Dubai](https://www.linkedin.com/company/arborsdubai/), was Kirigu Primary School, located in Nairobi, Kenya.

**The Far-Reaching Benefits of Free School Uniforms**

Free school uniforms provide a range of benefits that extend beyond just providing clothing. Here are some of the key benefits of our One For All program:

🏫** Improved Access to Education**: Providing free school uniforms to children in need can help remove financial barriers to education, ensuring that every child has the opportunity to attend school.

**👦 Improved Self-Esteem and Confidence**: Wearing a proper school uniform can help students feel a sense of pride and belonging, improving their self-esteem and confidence.

🎓 **Improved Academic Performance**: Research has shown that wearing a school uniform can lead to improved academic performance, as it creates a more focused learning environment and reduces distractions.

🏢 **Building Stronger Communities**: Free uniforms create a sense of unity among students and promote the idea that everyone should have access to education. Additionally, families can now use the money saved on uniforms for other essentials, such as food and shelter, benefiting the local economy.

**Joining Forces to Create a Brighter Future**

In conclusion, providing free school uniforms to children in need helps create stronger, more sustainable communities. At Kapes, we believe that every child deserves access to education, and providing a school uniform is a small but impactful way to make a difference.

Whether you are a school administrator, a teacher, a parent, a student, or someone who cares about the future of our planet, we encourage you to join us in our mission to make a positive impact through sustainable school uniforms.
