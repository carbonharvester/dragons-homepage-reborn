Your school probably calls its international trips "service learning." So does every other school.

But here's the uncomfortable question: is your trip actually service learning, or is it voluntourism with a curriculum guide stapled on?

The difference matters. Not just ethically — though that matters plenty — but practically. Schools are increasingly being called out by parents, students, and media for trips that look more like poverty tourism than education. The IB is tightening CAS criteria. Accreditation bodies are asking harder questions.

And communities in Kenya, Ghana, Cambodia, and dozens of other destinations are tired of being the stage set for someone else's personal growth narrative.

This is how to tell which category your trip falls into. And what to do about it.

## The Quick Test

Answer these honestly:

| Question | Voluntourism | Service Learning |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Who designed the project? | Trip company (for visitors) | Community (for community goals) |
| What happens when students leave? | Project stops | Work continues year-round |
| Who leads on the ground? | International staff | Local community members |
| What's measured? | Student satisfaction | Community outcomes |
| Could locals do this work? | Yes, usually better | Students join existing expertise |
| Does the school pay for transparency? | Budget is hidden | Line-item budget shared |

If you answered "voluntourism" to three or more questions, your trip probably is — regardless of what the brochure says.

## What Voluntourism Actually Looks Like

Voluntourism isn't always obvious. It doesn't always look like teenagers building a school they're unqualified to build. The modern version is subtler.

**The "service day" add-on.** A safari or adventure trip with a half-day "community visit" tacked on. Students interact briefly with a village, take photos, leave a donation, move on. The community receives almost nothing lasting. The school markets it as service learning.

**The rotating project.** A wall gets painted. A garden gets planted. A classroom gets "built." Next month, a different group arrives. Same wall. Same garden. The project exists to give visitors something to do.

**The orphanage visit.** Still happening, despite years of research showing orphanage tourism actively harms children. UNICEF estimates 80% of children in orphanages worldwide are not orphans — they're placed there to attract tourist donations.

**The skilled task given to unskilled visitors.** Students with no construction experience building structures. Students with no teaching qualifications "teaching" English. Students with no medical training doing health screenings. In every case, local professionals exist who could do this better — and would be employed if the trip money funded their work instead.

**The emotional extraction.** Programs designed to maximize emotional impact on visitors: heartbreaking stories, grateful children, dramatic before-and-after. The community performs poverty. Students perform compassion. Nobody's situation actually changes.

## What Real Service Learning Looks Like

Genuine service learning has specific characteristics that voluntourism cannot replicate because they require structural commitments, not just better marketing.

**Year-round programs that exist independent of visits.** The community work happens every day. Student groups visit during scheduled windows and participate in what's already underway. The acid test: would this program survive if no student group ever visited again?

**Community-defined priorities.** Local leaders decide what work matters. Not the trip company. Not the school. Communities have agency over their own development. Students join a community's agenda, not the other way around.

**Local leadership on the ground.** The people who live there lead the programs. Kenyan staff run operations in Kenya. Cambodian staff run operations in Cambodia. International coordination happens, but authority lives locally.

**Curriculum integration before, during, and after.** Pre-trip modules that address power dynamics, colonial history, and ethical engagement. On-ground learning led by community experts. Post-trip reflection that moves beyond "I'm grateful" to systemic understanding.

**Financial transparency.** Schools know where their money goes. Line-item budgets are shared. A majority of trip costs stay in the local economy. Community staff are paid year-round, not seasonally.

**Measured community outcomes.** Not "97% of students said life-changing." Instead: meals served daily, water access points built, women's cooperative income generated, school enrollment rates. Published data, not marketing claims.

## Why This Distinction Matters Now

Three things are changing that make this urgent for schools:

**1. Students are more informed.** Gen Z has grown up with social media criticism of voluntourism. They've read the articles. They've seen the TikToks calling out white saviorism. Sending them on an unexamined trip risks backlash from the students themselves.

**2. Parents are asking harder questions.** "Where does our $5,000 go?" is a question more parents are asking. They've seen the investigations. They want transparency, not brochures.

**3. Accreditation and IB criteria are tightening.** CAS requirements increasingly emphasize community benefit, not just student reflection. Schools need to demonstrate genuine impact, not just intent.

## What To Do If Your Trip Is Closer to Voluntourism

Don't cancel it. Fix it.

**Step 1: Ask the hard questions.** Use a structured checklist to evaluate your current provider. We built one — 7 questions with "good answer" and "red flag" benchmarks for each.

**[Download the Transparency Checklist →](/resources/transparency-checklist)**

**Step 2: Evaluate the structure, not just the marketing.** Does the work continue year-round? Are locals leading? Where does the money go? These are structural questions, not cosmetic ones.

**Step 3: Talk to the community, not just past clients.** References from other schools tell you about the student experience. Conversations with community leaders tell you about the community impact. Both matter. Most providers only offer the first.

**Step 4: Consider a different model.** If your current provider can't answer the structural questions, it may be time to find one that can. Community-based models with year-round programs exist — they're just not the loudest voices in the market.

## FAQ

### Is all voluntourism bad?
The issue isn't volunteering abroad — it's the structure. Programs designed for visitors, that stop when visitors leave, and that put unskilled people in roles locals could fill better — those cause harm regardless of intent. Programs with year-round operations, community leadership, and measured outcomes are a different category entirely.

### My school's trip provider says they're "community-based." How do I verify?
Ask for specifics: Who are the community partners? Can you talk to them directly? What happens between student visits? What community outcome data do you publish? Genuine community-based providers will answer these readily. Evasive responses are a signal.

### Can voluntourism be reformed or should schools stop going?
Schools should keep going — but differently. The answer isn't to stop engaging with global communities. It's to engage in ways that center community benefit, maintain local leadership, and demonstrate measurable outcomes. This requires choosing providers built for this model, not trying to reform providers built for the old one.
