Here's the thing about CAS trips: most of them don't actually meet the IB's requirements.

Schools send students abroad for a week or two, call it a CAS experience, upload some photos to ManageBac, and move on. Students write a reflection about being "grateful." The CAS coordinator checks a box. Everyone feels good.

But the IB didn't design CAS for a one-week trip with a reflection essay stapled on. The framework is more demanding than that — deliberately so. And as the IB tightens its criteria and moderators look more closely at CAS portfolios, schools that treat international trips as automatic CAS credit are running into problems.

This guide breaks down what the IB actually requires from CAS, why most international trips fall short, and how to design service experiences that genuinely meet the requirements while benefiting the communities involved. Because those two things — meeting IB standards and doing right by communities — turn out to require the same structural commitments.

## What the IB Actually Requires from CAS

Before designing a trip, you need to understand the framework you're designing for. Too many schools skip this step, treating CAS as a vague mandate to "do service." It's not.

### The 7 Learning Outcomes

Every CAS student must demonstrate all seven learning outcomes across their CAS programme:

1. **Identify own strengths and develop areas for growth.** Self-awareness, not self-congratulation.
2. **Demonstrate that challenges have been undertaken, developing new skills.** Genuine stretch, not comfort-zone repetition.
3. **Demonstrate how to initiate and plan a CAS experience.** Student agency, not just participation in something adults organized.
4. **Show commitment to and perseverance in CAS experiences.** Sustained engagement over time. Not a one-off.
5. **Demonstrate the skills and recognize the benefits of working collaboratively.** Meaningful collaboration — with each other and with community partners.
6. **Demonstrate engagement with issues of global significance.** Systemic understanding, not surface-level exposure.
7. **Recognize and consider the ethics of choices and actions.** This is where most voluntourism trips fail hardest. Ethical engagement isn't optional — it's a learning outcome.

A two-week trip can touch on several of these. It cannot demonstrate sustained commitment, student-initiated planning, or deep ethical consideration unless it's embedded in a much longer process.

### The 5 Stages

The IB expects CAS experiences to move through five stages: **investigation, preparation, action, reflection, and demonstration.** Most trips only cover action (the trip itself) and maybe a thin version of reflection (the post-trip essay).

Investigation means students research the context before going — the community, the issues, the history. Preparation means students plan meaningfully, not just pack bags. Reflection happens throughout, not just afterward. Demonstration means sharing learning with others in a substantive way.

A trip that skips investigation and preparation isn't meeting the CAS framework. It's a field trip with a CAS label.

### The CAS Project Requirement

This is the one that catches schools off guard. Every IB Diploma student must complete at least one **CAS project** — a collaborative, sustained series of experiences lasting **at least one month.** A CAS project must address all five stages and involve collaboration.

A two-week trip can be part of a CAS project. It cannot be the entire CAS project. The math doesn't work, and the depth doesn't work.

Schools that understand this design their international trips as the centerpiece of a longer arc: months of preparation before, the trip itself, and months of follow-up after. Schools that don't understand this have students scrambling to retrofit a trip into a CAS project that doesn't hold up under moderation.

## Why Most "CAS Trips" Fall Short

If you've read our guide on [voluntourism vs. service learning](/blog/voluntourism-vs-service-learning), you already know the structural problems with most international service trips. Those same problems make them poor CAS experiences.

**The trip is designed by the provider, not the students.** Learning outcome 3 requires students to initiate and plan. When a trip company hands students a pre-built itinerary and calls it CAS, students aren't planning anything — they're participating in someone else's plan. CAS coordinators know the difference, and so do moderators.

**There's no sustained engagement.** Learning outcome 4 requires commitment and perseverance over time. A stand-alone trip — even a good one — doesn't demonstrate sustained engagement. It demonstrates participation in an event.

**Ethical reflection is superficial or absent.** Learning outcome 7 is about the ethics of choices and actions. A trip that doesn't address power dynamics, the history of aid, or the ethics of international volunteering isn't meeting this outcome. Writing "I learned to be grateful" isn't ethical reflection. It's the voluntourism response.

**The "service" is designed for visitors, not communities.** When the project exists because student groups are coming — and stops when they leave — it's not service. It's performance. Communities become props in someone else's learning experience. The IB's emphasis on ethical engagement and global significance demands more than this.

**There's no pre-trip curriculum.** Investigation and preparation stages require substantive engagement before the trip. A packing list and a logistical briefing don't count.

**The IB is paying closer attention.** We've heard from CAS coordinators at multiple schools that moderation is getting more rigorous. Portfolios that consist of trip photos and a reflection essay are being flagged. The IB wants evidence of all five stages and all seven learning outcomes — not just the easy ones.

## What Makes a Trip Genuinely CAS-Worthy

A CAS-worthy international trip shares the same characteristics as [ethical school travel](/blog/ethical-school-trips-guide): community-defined priorities, local leadership, year-round operations, and transparency. But it adds layers specific to the CAS framework.

**Community-defined priorities.** Students don't arrive to "help." They arrive to learn from and contribute to work that communities have designed for their own goals. This is both more ethical and more aligned with CAS — students engage with real global issues as defined by the people living them, not as packaged by a trip company.

**Pre-trip curriculum that goes deep.** Not a single assembly. Months of structured learning: the history and politics of the region, the specific development challenges, the ethics of international engagement, and the systems that connect students' lives to the community they'll visit. This is the investigation and preparation that CAS demands.

**Structured reflection throughout.** Daily guided reflection during the trip. Not journaling prompts about feelings — structured frameworks that connect experiences to the UN Sustainable Development Goals, to students' academic coursework, to systemic questions about equity and development.

**Local leadership.** Community members lead the learning. They're the experts. Students learn alongside people who have spent years building solutions, not alongside a Western tour guide narrating someone else's story.

**Year-round programs students plug into.** The work doesn't start when students arrive or stop when they leave. Student groups visit during scheduled windows and contribute to programs that operate 365 days a year. This means the trip connects to something real and ongoing — which is exactly what sustained engagement looks like.

**Post-trip follow-up that extends for months.** The trip is the midpoint, not the endpoint. Students continue engaging after they return: analyzing data, creating presentations, fundraising for specific programs, communicating with community partners. This is what turns a two-week trip into a CAS project that meets the one-month minimum.

## Concrete CAS Project Ideas Connected to Real Programs

Theory is useful. Specifics are better. Here are CAS project ideas built around Kapes Adventures' year-round programs in Kenya — the kind of sustained, community-led work that holds up under IB scrutiny.

### Seeds2Education Permaculture Gardens

**The program:** Community-designed permaculture gardens at rural schools that provide daily meals for 200+ students. The gardens operate year-round, managed by trained local staff and community members. They address food security, nutrition, and environmental sustainability simultaneously.

**The CAS project:** Students spend 2-3 months pre-trip researching food security in East Africa, permaculture principles, and the connection between nutrition and education access. During the trip, they work alongside Kenyan agricultural staff in the gardens — planting, harvesting, learning soil science and water management from people who do this every day. Post-trip, students create educational materials about food security for their own school community and maintain a fundraising relationship with the garden program.

**CAS strands:** Service (contributing to a feeding program), Activity (physical farm work), Creativity (designing educational materials, documentary photography).

**Global significance:** SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 13 (Climate Action).

### Water Cooperative Development

**The program:** Community-managed water cooperatives that provide clean water access and generate income for women's groups. The cooperatives are owned and operated by local women, creating both infrastructure and economic empowerment.

**The CAS project:** Pre-trip research into water access, gender equity, and cooperative economics. During the trip, students learn from women leaders who run the cooperatives — the business model, the social dynamics, the engineering. Post-trip, students develop a presentation on water access and gender equity that they deliver to younger students or community groups.

**CAS strands:** Service (supporting water infrastructure), Activity (physical work at water points), Creativity (storytelling, photography, presentation design).

**Global significance:** SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth).

### School Feeding Programs

**The program:** Daily meals for hundreds of children at partner schools, directly tied to enrollment and attendance rates. Kapes tracks the data: when meals are consistent, attendance rises measurably. When funding gaps occur, children drop out.

**The CAS project:** Students investigate the relationship between nutrition and education access, studying data from Kapes' partner schools alongside global research. During the trip, they participate in meal preparation, visit the supply chain, and interview families about how the feeding program has changed their children's lives. Post-trip, students launch a sustained fundraising campaign at their school — not a bake sale, but a structured campaign tied to specific outcomes (e.g., funding 100 meals per day for a semester).

**CAS strands:** Service (direct contribution to a feeding program), Activity (meal preparation, food distribution logistics), Creativity (campaign design, storytelling).

**Global significance:** SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 4 (Quality Education).

### Community Conservation

**The program:** Conservation programs focused on wildlife corridors and human-wildlife coexistence. Local community members lead efforts that balance conservation with the needs of families who live alongside wildlife — because conservation that ignores people doesn't work.

**The CAS project:** Pre-trip study of conservation biology, human-wildlife conflict, and the politics of land use in East Africa. During the trip, students participate in conservation monitoring, learn from community rangers, and see firsthand how conservation and community development intersect. Post-trip, students create a multimedia project documenting the human side of conservation and present it at school or community events.

**CAS strands:** Service (contributing to conservation monitoring), Activity (conservation walks, physical fieldwork), Creativity (documentary filmmaking, photography, writing).

**Global significance:** SDG 13 (Climate Action), SDG 15 (Life on Land), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities).

## How to Map Trip Activities to CAS Strands

One of the practical challenges CAS coordinators face is ensuring students cover all three CAS strands — Creativity, Activity, and Service — during the trip. Here's how to do it without forcing artificial activities.

### Service

This is the obvious one. Every program above is service — but genuine service, not manufactured tasks. Students contribute to work that exists independent of their visit. The community defines the priorities. Local staff lead the programs. The key distinction: students are adding capacity to existing work, not creating work that exists only for them.

### Activity

Physical engagement is built into community-based programs naturally. Working in permaculture gardens is physical labor. Walking conservation transects is physical activity. Helping with meal preparation and distribution involves sustained physical effort. You don't need to bolt on a hike or a sports day — the work itself is active.

### Creativity

This is where most trips fall short, and it's where intentional design makes the biggest difference.

- **Documentary photography and filmmaking.** Students document the programs, the community, and their own learning — with ethical photography training as part of the pre-trip curriculum. The resulting work serves both the student's CAS portfolio and the community partner's communication needs.
- **Storytelling and writing.** Students write profiles of community leaders, case studies of programs, or reflective essays that go beyond personal narrative to systemic analysis.
- **Educational material design.** Students create resources — posters, lesson plans, digital content — that the community or school can actually use.
- **Campaign and presentation design.** The post-trip fundraising campaign or school presentation requires genuine creative work: graphic design, public speaking, persuasive writing.

The point is that Creativity shouldn't be an afterthought. When planned intentionally, the creative strand produces some of the most meaningful CAS evidence — and the most useful outputs for community partners.

## The Pre-Trip and Post-Trip Curriculum That Makes CAS Work

The trip itself is maybe 20% of what makes a CAS project successful. The other 80% is what happens before and after.

### Pre-Trip (2-3 Months Before)

**Month 1: Investigation.** Students research the region, the community, and the specific issues they'll engage with. This isn't a Wikipedia skim — it's structured inquiry. Reading academic sources on food security, watching documentaries about water access, analyzing data from Kapes' published impact reports. Students formulate questions they want to explore on the ground.

**Month 2: Preparation and Context.** Students engage with the ethics of international service. They read about voluntourism. They discuss power dynamics, colonial history, and the white savior complex. They learn about ethical photography and storytelling. This is where learning outcome 7 — recognizing the ethics of choices and actions — gets its foundation.

**Month 3: Planning and Logistics.** Students take ownership of specific aspects of the trip planning, building evidence for learning outcome 3. They set personal CAS goals, plan their creative projects, and prepare specific contributions they'll make to the programs.

### During the Trip (1-2 Weeks)

**Daily structured reflection.** Not optional. Not just journaling. Guided prompts that connect daily experiences to the investigation done before the trip. What surprised you? What challenged your assumptions? How does what you saw today connect to the systems you studied?

**Community-led learning sessions.** Local experts teach students directly. A permaculture specialist explains soil science. A water cooperative leader explains cooperative economics. A conservation ranger explains human-wildlife coexistence. Students are learners, not helpers.

**Documentation and creative work.** Students capture their learning through photography, video, writing, or other creative media — with the ethical frameworks discussed in pre-trip sessions actively applied.

### Post-Trip (2-3 Months After)

**Month 1: Processing and analysis.** Students synthesize their experiences. They analyze the data they collected. They refine their creative projects. They connect their on-ground learning to broader academic frameworks.

**Month 2: Demonstration.** Students share their learning with the school community — through presentations, exhibitions, articles, or events. This is the demonstration stage that CAS requires and most trips skip entirely.

**Month 3: Sustained action.** Students maintain their connection to the programs. This might mean running a fundraising campaign, corresponding with community partners, or creating resources that support the ongoing work. This is what turns a trip into sustained engagement.

This arc — investigation through demonstration — is what makes a trip CAS-worthy. Not the trip alone. The entire process.

## FAQ

### Can a single international trip fulfill all CAS requirements?

No — and the IB doesn't expect it to. A trip can be a powerful component of a student's CAS programme, but CAS requires sustained engagement across all three strands over the full Diploma period. A trip works best as the centerpiece of a longer CAS project (minimum one month) that includes pre-trip investigation, the trip itself, and months of post-trip follow-up and demonstration.

### How long does a CAS project need to be?

The IB requires CAS projects to last at least one month and involve collaboration. A two-week trip alone doesn't meet this threshold. But a project that includes two months of pre-trip preparation, the trip, and two months of post-trip work easily exceeds it — and produces much stronger portfolio evidence.

### What if our school already has a trip provider — can we add CAS structure to an existing trip?

Sometimes. If your current provider runs year-round community programs with local leadership and measured outcomes, you can build CAS structure around the trip with pre- and post-trip curriculum. If your provider runs visit-dependent projects that stop when students leave, the structural problems go deeper than what a curriculum wrapper can fix. Our article on [voluntourism vs. service learning](/blog/voluntourism-vs-service-learning) has a diagnostic table that helps you evaluate this.

### Do students need to do all three CAS strands during the trip?

Not necessarily during the trip alone — CAS strands need to be covered across the full CAS programme. But a well-designed trip naturally covers all three: Service through community programs, Activity through physical engagement, and Creativity through documentation, storytelling, and project design. Covering all three during the trip makes portfolio documentation much more straightforward.

### How do we handle ethical concerns about international service trips in a CAS context?

This is actually where CAS and ethical travel align perfectly. Learning outcome 7 requires students to "recognize and consider the ethics of choices and actions." A pre-trip curriculum that addresses voluntourism, power dynamics, and ethical engagement directly serves this learning outcome. The ethical concerns aren't obstacles to CAS — they're CAS content. Students who grapple seriously with these questions produce some of the strongest CAS reflections we've seen.
