# Global Citizenship Through School Travel: Beyond the Buzzword

Open any independent school's website and count how many seconds it takes to find the phrase "global citizen." I'll wait. It's usually under ten.

Now ask someone at that school to define what it means. That's where things get uncomfortable.

"Global citizenship" has become the educational equivalent of "synergy" — a phrase everyone uses and nobody interrogates. It appears in mission statements, trip brochures, admissions materials, and graduation speeches. It decorates the walls of international programs offices and the headers of travel company websites. Including, I'll be honest, some of my own early marketing.

But here's what I've come to understand after more than a decade of designing school travel programs across East Africa: global citizenship is either a rigorous educational framework that can genuinely transform how young people understand the world, or it's a comfortable lie we tell ourselves to justify expensive trips abroad. The difference comes down to pedagogy, not geography.

## The buzzword problem

The overuse of "global citizenship" isn't just annoying — it's actively harmful. When a term means everything, it means nothing. And when it means nothing, we stop asking hard questions about whether our programs are actually achieving anything.

I've sat in planning meetings where a school's entire global citizenship strategy amounts to "we send students to three continents by the time they graduate." Full stop. No learning framework. No assessment criteria. No follow-up. The trip itself is treated as sufficient evidence of global citizenship development.

This is like claiming students are mathematically literate because they've visited three math classrooms.

The real cost of the buzzword problem is that it lets schools off the hook. If global citizenship is just exposure to other places, then any trip counts. If any trip counts, there's no reason to invest in the harder work of curriculum integration, structured reflection, community partnership, or post-trip engagement. The label becomes a substitute for the learning.

## What the frameworks actually say

Beneath the marketing, there are substantive, well-researched frameworks for global citizenship education. They deserve to be taken seriously.

**UNESCO's Global Citizenship Education framework** identifies three core domains:

- **Cognitive:** Understanding local, national, and global issues and the interconnectedness of systems, structures, and processes
- **Socio-emotional:** Developing a sense of belonging to a common humanity, respect for difference and diversity, and empathy
- **Behavioural:** Acting effectively and responsibly at local, national, and global levels for a more peaceful and sustainable world

Notice what's absent from that framework: passport stamps.

**The OECD Global Competence framework** is equally specific. It defines a globally competent person as someone who can:

1. Examine local, global, and intercultural issues
2. Understand and appreciate the perspectives and worldviews of others
3. Engage in open, appropriate, and effective interactions across cultures
4. Take action for collective well-being and sustainable development

The **IB Learner Profile** adds attributes like being knowledgeable, principled, open-minded, caring, and reflective — qualities that must be developed deliberately, not absorbed through proximity.

These aren't vague aspirations. They're measurable competencies. And they demand intentional pedagogy, not just logistics.

## What the research shows — and what it doesn't

Here's the good news: educational travel genuinely can develop global competencies. Research published in the *Journal of Teaching in Travel & Tourism* demonstrates that well-designed experiential programs produce measurable growth in intercultural understanding, systems thinking, and perspective-taking ability.

Here's the catch: the travel itself isn't the active ingredient. It's the pedagogical design around the travel.

Short-term international experiences without structured reflection, curriculum integration, and guided meaning-making don't reliably change student attitudes or competencies. In some cases, they can actually reinforce stereotypes rather than challenge them. A student who spends a week in a rural Kenyan community without adequate preparation and processing may come home with a stronger saviour narrative, not a weaker one.

The research is clear on what makes the difference:

- **Pre-trip preparation** that builds contextual knowledge, examines student assumptions, and establishes clear learning objectives
- **In-program reflection** that goes beyond journaling to include facilitated discussions, critical analysis, and perspective-taking exercises
- **Post-trip integration** that connects the experience to ongoing curriculum, community engagement, and personal action
- **Duration and depth** — longer, more immersive experiences generally produce stronger outcomes, but well-designed short programs can be effective when embedded in a broader learning arc

The research also raises a critical perspective that practitioners can't afford to ignore.

## The decolonial challenge

Here's the question we don't ask often enough: whose version of "global citizenship" are we teaching?

Post-colonial scholars have pointed out something uncomfortable about the way global citizenship is typically framed in Western education. When students from wealthy schools in the Global North travel to communities in the Global South, the implicit narrative is that the students are the "citizens" — the agents, the learners, the future leaders — and the communities they visit are the backdrop, the learning resource, the "experience."

This framing is not neutral. It reproduces colonial power dynamics under a progressive label.

Good global citizenship education confronts this directly. It asks students to interrogate their own positionality: Why do I have the resources to travel here? What systems make my mobility possible while restricting others'? Whose knowledge counts in this interaction? What right do I have to "learn from" this community, and what obligations come with that?

At Kapes Adventures, we've built this critical lens into our program design. It makes some educators uncomfortable at first. But the discomfort is the point. Global citizenship without critical self-examination is tourism with a better press kit.

Communities in our programs are partners, not projects. Local experts lead sessions not because it's a nice optic, but because they hold knowledge that visiting students and teachers genuinely need. The learning flows in the direction it should — from people who understand the context to people who are trying to.

This isn't about guilt. It's about accuracy. And accurate understanding of global systems is the foundation of genuine global competence.

## What global citizenship looks like in practice

Theory matters. But teachers need to know what this looks like on the ground. Here's what we've seen work through Kapes programs:

**Students learning from Kenyan experts, not teaching them.** When a Maasai elder explains land management practices that have sustained ecosystems for centuries, students encounter deep expertise that challenges their assumptions about who holds knowledge. When a Kenyan marine biologist leads a coral reef survey, students see scientific leadership from the Global South — something many of them have never been exposed to.

**Understanding food security as a systemic issue, not a charity problem.** Students don't distribute food. They study why food insecurity exists — examining trade policies, climate impacts, land tenure systems, and post-colonial economic structures. They meet farmers innovating solutions, not waiting for rescue. This is the cognitive dimension of the UNESCO framework in action: understanding interconnected systems.

**Seeing conservation as economics, not just environmentalism.** When students understand that a community's relationship to wildlife is shaped by livelihood pressures, land rights, and market access, they move beyond simplistic "save the animals" narratives. They begin to think in systems, recognizing that conservation outcomes depend on economic justice. This is global competence — examining issues from multiple perspectives.

**Recognizing water access as a gender equity issue.** When students learn that women and girls in parts of East Africa spend hours each day collecting water — time that could otherwise go to education and economic participation — they begin to see how a single resource issue connects to gender, education, economics, and human rights. That interconnected understanding is the heart of global citizenship.

In each case, the learning isn't "look at this problem." It's "understand this system." That distinction is everything.

## How to measure global citizenship development

If global citizenship is a real educational outcome, it has to be measurable. Not everything that counts can be counted, but we can do far better than "students enjoyed the trip."

**Pre/post surveys on global attitudes.** Validated instruments like the Global Perspectives Inventory and the Intercultural Development Inventory measure specific dimensions of global competence. Administer them before and after the program, and you have real data.

**Portfolio evidence.** Students compile reflective work — writing, media, projects — that demonstrates growth across the cognitive, socio-emotional, and behavioural dimensions. Teachers assess this work against rubrics aligned to frameworks like UNESCO's or the OECD's.

**Behavioural indicators.** The most important question: do students take action after returning? Do they engage with global issues in their school and community? Do they change consumption patterns, volunteer commitments, or academic focus? Behaviour change is the strongest evidence that something meaningful happened.

**The systems test.** This is one I use informally but find enormously revealing. Ask a student to explain a complex issue they encountered on the trip using systems thinking. Can they identify multiple causes, feedback loops, unintended consequences, and stakeholder perspectives? If they can, global competence is developing. If they reduce it to a simple problem with a simple solution, there's more work to do.

These measurement approaches aren't just for accountability. They're for improvement. When you know what's working and what isn't, you can refine program design to produce stronger outcomes.

For a structured approach to evaluating your programs, [our scorecard tool](/scorecard) helps schools assess trip quality against research-backed criteria.

## The long game: one trip is not enough

I need to be direct about something that's inconvenient for a travel company to say: one trip does not create a global citizen. It can't. The frameworks are too multidimensional, the competencies too complex, the habits of mind too deeply rooted.

What a well-designed trip can do is catalyse something. It can create a disruption in a student's worldview that, if supported properly, leads to genuine growth. But the key phrase is "if supported properly."

This is why the most effective approaches to global citizenship education through travel involve:

**Multi-year school partnerships.** Rather than one-off trips, schools build ongoing relationships with specific communities. Students in Year 9 might begin with a domestic program focused on local-global connections. Students in Year 10 might engage in virtual exchange with a partner school in Kenya. Students in Year 11 might travel. Students in Year 12 might lead a project that applies what they've learned. Each year builds on the last.

**Ongoing engagement between trips.** The learning doesn't stop when the plane lands. Virtual sessions with community partners, student-led research projects, integration with classroom curriculum — these keep the experience alive and deepen understanding over time.

**School-wide curriculum integration.** Global citizenship isn't a co-curricular bolt-on. It's a lens that can be applied across subjects — in science (climate systems, biodiversity), humanities (colonialism, migration, human rights), mathematics (economic inequality, data literacy), and arts (cultural expression, identity). When the trip connects to what students learn in every classroom, the impact compounds.

**Teacher development.** Teachers need support to facilitate this kind of learning. Most received no training in global citizenship pedagogy. Investing in teacher capacity — through workshops, coaching, and [curriculum resources](/curriculum-guide) — is often the highest-leverage intervention a school can make.

The trip is a catalyst, not the whole journey. Schools that understand this produce students who don't just talk about global citizenship. They practice it.

## Getting started

If your school is ready to move beyond the buzzword, here's where to begin:

1. **Audit your current language.** Where does "global citizenship" appear in your materials? Can you define what you mean by it? Can your students?
2. **Choose a framework.** UNESCO, OECD, or IB — pick one and align your programming to its specific competencies. This gives you both a design guide and an assessment structure.
3. **Evaluate your current trips.** Use the [ethical school trips guide](/blog/ethical-school-trips-guide) and the [voluntourism vs. service learning framework](/blog/voluntourism-vs-service-learning) to assess whether your existing programs are developing global competence or just providing exposure.
4. **Invest in curriculum integration.** Connect trip experiences to classroom learning before, during, and after travel. Our [curriculum guide](/curriculum-guide) provides a starting framework.
5. **Plan a conversation.** If you want to explore what a research-aligned global citizenship program could look like for your school, [book a call](https://calendly.com/kapesadventures) and we'll work through it together.

Global citizenship is worth fighting for as a concept. But only if we're willing to do the work it actually requires.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is global citizenship education, and how does it differ from international travel?

Global citizenship education is a structured pedagogical approach that develops students' ability to understand interconnected global systems, appreciate diverse perspectives, and take responsible action. It draws on formal frameworks from UNESCO, the OECD, and the IB. International travel is simply going somewhere. Travel can be a powerful tool within global citizenship education, but only when it's embedded in intentional curriculum design with preparation, facilitation, reflection, and follow-up. Without that pedagogical structure, travel is just geography, not education.

### Can a short school trip really develop global citizens?

A single short trip won't produce a fully formed global citizen — no single experience can. But research shows that even shorter programs can catalyse meaningful growth in global competencies when they're well-designed. The critical factors are structured pre-trip preparation, expert-led in-program learning, guided reflection, and post-trip curriculum integration. A five-day program embedded in a year-long learning arc will produce far stronger outcomes than a two-week trip with no pedagogical framework. Duration matters less than design.

### How do we avoid reinforcing stereotypes or saviour mentalities on school trips?

This requires deliberate program design. Students need pre-trip work that examines their assumptions and positionality. In-program, they should learn from local experts rather than positioning themselves as helpers or teachers. The curriculum should focus on systemic analysis rather than individual need — understanding why challenges exist rather than swooping in to fix them. Communities should be genuine partners in program design, not passive recipients. And post-trip reflection should explicitly address power dynamics. Our [ethical school trips guide](/blog/ethical-school-trips-guide) covers this in depth.

### How can schools measure whether their travel programs are developing global competence?

Schools can use validated survey instruments like the Global Perspectives Inventory to measure attitudinal change before and after programs. Portfolio-based assessment allows students to demonstrate growth through reflective work evaluated against rubric criteria aligned to global competence frameworks. Behavioural indicators — whether students take sustained action on global issues after returning — provide the strongest evidence of genuine development. The "systems test," asking students to explain a complex issue using systems thinking, is a practical informal assessment any teacher can use. Our [scorecard](/scorecard) provides a structured evaluation framework.

### What does a multi-year global citizenship program look like?

A well-structured multi-year program builds progressively. It might begin with local-global connection projects that help students see global systems operating in their own community. Virtual exchanges with partner schools in other countries can follow, building cross-cultural relationships and communication skills. An in-country immersive experience provides direct encounter with different perspectives, systems, and ways of knowing. Post-trip, students apply their learning through sustained engagement — research projects, community action, mentoring younger students, or ongoing collaboration with international partners. Throughout, classroom curriculum across subjects reinforces global citizenship competencies so the travel experience connects to everything else students are learning.
