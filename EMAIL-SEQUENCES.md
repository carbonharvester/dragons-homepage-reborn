### Email 1: Results + Quick Win

**Send:** Immediately after scorecard completion
**Subject:** Your scorecard results are in
**Preview:** Plus one thing you can do this week

Hey {{Name}},

Your Impact Scorecard results are ready: **[VIEW YOUR RESULTS](link)**

You scored **{{Score}}/80** — putting you in the **"{{Category}}"** category.

Here's one thing you can do this week based on your results:

**Ask your current trip provider this question:** "What happens to the project when our students leave?"

If they pause, hedge, or redirect to how great the student experience is — that tells you everything about whether the program is built for the community or for visitors.

Over the next two weeks, I'll send you a few emails with practical insights on the gaps the scorecard revealed. Everything is based on what we've learned running year-round programs in Kenya.

No sales pitch coming. Just the stuff I wish someone had told me before I started building Kapes.

— Matthew

P.S. If you want to talk through your results with someone on our Kenya team, you can book a call anytime: **[BOOK A CALL](calendly link)**

### Email 2: The Story Behind the Scorecard

**Send:** Day 2
**Subject:** Why I built this scorecard
**Preview:** A conversation in the Kasigau Corridor changed everything

Quick story:

In 2022, I was standing in Kenya's Kasigau Corridor — home to the world's first carbon-neutral factory — watching a school group "volunteer" at a local school.

Twenty teenagers painting a wall that had been painted six times that year by six different groups.

The local teachers watched from the side. The kids at the school watched from the side. Everyone performed their roles. The volunteers felt great. The community got nothing lasting.

I kept asking: why does no one measure what actually changes for the community?

That's why the scorecard exists. Not to sell trips — to give schools a way to honestly ask whether their current programs are working for the communities they visit, not just for the students on the bus.

Your score was {{Score}}/80. Whether that surprised you or confirmed what you already suspected, the important thing is that you asked the question.

Tomorrow: nothing. Day after tomorrow, I'll share the one gap that shows up in almost every school's results — and why it matters more than any other.

— Matthew

---

### Email 3: The Gap Most Schools Miss

**Send:** Day 4
**Subject:** The gap that shows up in every scorecard
**Preview:** It's not the one you'd expect

After hundreds of schools have taken the scorecard, one pattern is clear:

**Almost no school can answer what happens to the project between visits.**

The student experience section? Schools score well there. Curriculum integration? Often decent. Ethics and accountability? Improving.

But "community continuity" — what happens on the ground when students aren't there — that's where scores collapse.

Here's why it matters:

If a program only operates when visitors are present, it was designed for visitors. The community is the backdrop, not the beneficiary.

The test is simple: Does the work continue 365 days a year, or only during the 14 days your students are there?

At Kapes, our Seeds2Education gardens feed 200+ children daily. Our water cooperatives operate year-round. Our community staff are paid every month, not seasonally.

Student visits are windows into continuous work. They amplify what's happening — they don't create it.

**One thing to try:** Ask your current provider for a photo or update from a month when no visiting group was present. Their response will tell you a lot.

— Matthew

---

### Email 4: What 72% Means

**Send:** Day 7
**Subject:** Where does your $5,000 per student actually go?
**Preview:** Most schools have never asked this question

Here's a number most trip providers won't share: **what percentage of your trip budget stays in the community?**

Industry average? Roughly 10-15%. The rest goes to international operators, Western staff, marketing, and overhead.

At Kapes, 72% of revenue stays in Kenya. That means Kenyan-led teams, local suppliers, community staff, and direct program funding.

We share line-item budgets before you book. Not ranges. Not estimates. Line items.

Why? Because if you're spending $5,000 per student and sending 20 students, that's $100,000. Parents deserve to know where it goes. Communities deserve to receive it.

Here's a question worth asking any provider: **"Can you share a line-item budget breakdown before we commit?"**

If the answer is no, ask yourself why.

— Matthew

P.S. We built a free checklist of 7 questions to ask any trip provider. If you want it: **[GET THE CHECKLIST](/resources/transparency-checklist)**

---

### Email 5: What Happens When Students Leave

**Send:** Day 10
**Subject:** The question your trip provider hopes you never ask
**Preview:** And the honest answer

Your scorecard results showed how your program performs across 5 dimensions. But there's one question that cuts through all of them:

**"What happens when our students leave?"**

If the honest answer is "the project stops" — then it wasn't built for the community. It was built for the visitor experience.

Here's what happens at Kapes when students leave:

- Gardens keep feeding 200+ children daily
- Water cooperatives keep operating
- Community staff keep working
- New schools get added to the program
- Seeds2Education expands to new sites

Student visits generate revenue that funds the year-round work. But the work doesn't depend on visits to exist.

That's not a philosophy. It's an operating model.

If your scorecard revealed gaps in community continuity, this is why. Most programs aren't structured this way. Most can't be — it would require rebuilding from the ground up.

— Matthew

---

### Email 6: How Schools Like Yours Work With Us

**Send:** Day 13
**Subject:** What a partnership with Kapes actually looks like
**Preview:** It's not what most schools expect

By now you've seen the gaps the scorecard reveals.

Here's what schools do about them:

**Year 1: A trip that's different from day one.**

Your students don't arrive as helpers. They arrive as learners. They join existing programs — Seeds2Education gardens, water cooperatives, school feeding — alongside the Kenyan teams already doing the work.

Pre-trip curriculum prepares them. On-ground learning with local experts deepens it. Post-trip reflection makes it stick.

**Year 2+: A partnership that grows.**

Schools that return don't repeat the same trip. The curriculum evolves. Student projects build on what previous groups started. Your school becomes part of a community relationship, not a one-time transaction.

**What this means practically:**

- 10-30 students, 2 leaders, local rangers
- 5-10 day programs (customizable)
- Pre-trip curriculum modules
- Line-item budget shared before booking
- 72% of revenue stays in Kenya
- Post-trip impact report on what your group contributed to

This isn't a trip you book from a catalog. It's a partnership you build with our team.

If that's interesting, the easiest next step is a 20-minute call with our Kenya team. No pitch. Just a conversation about what's possible for your school.

**[BOOK A CALL](calendly link)**

— Matthew

---

### Email 7: One Question

**Send:** Day 16
**Subject:** Quick question about your scorecard
**Preview:** And then back to regular emails

{{Name}},

You took the scorecard {{X}} days ago and scored {{Score}}/80.

Quick question: did anything change?

Did you ask your provider any of the questions I mentioned? Did you look at your program differently? Did you decide you're happy with where things are?

Any answer is fine. I'm genuinely curious.

If you want to explore what a Kapes partnership would look like for {{School}}, our Kenya team can walk you through it in 20 minutes. No commitment. No sales deck. Just a conversation.

**[BOOK A 20-MIN CALL](calendly link)**

If now isn't the right time, no worries. I'll keep sending occasional emails with insights on ethical school travel. You can reply anytime.

— Matthew

P.S. If someone else at {{School}} should be part of this conversation — a department head, trip coordinator, or principal — feel free to forward this. Or send me their email and I'll reach out directly.

## Sequence 2: PDF Download Follow-Up (5 emails)

**Trigger:** Downloads any PDF lead magnet (Transparency Checklist, Ethical Planning Guide, or Impact Report)
**Data available:** Name, role, school, country, email, which PDF they downloaded
**Goal:** Build trust through value, then move to Calendly booking

### Sequence Overview

| # | Name | Send | Purpose |
|---|------|------|---------|
| 1 | Delivery + Quick Start | Immediately | Deliver the PDF, one action step |
| 2 | Why This Exists | Day 3 | Connection — the story behind the resource |
| 3 | The Deeper Problem | Day 6 | Teach — expand on the PDF's core topic |
| 4 | What We Built Instead | Day 10 | Bridge — show how Kapes solves it |
| 5 | Next Step | Day 14 | Soft pitch — Calendly or Scorecard |

---

### Email 1: Delivery + Quick Start

**Send:** Immediately after form submission
**Subject:** Your {{PDFName}} is ready
**Preview:** Plus the one page to read first

Hey {{Name}},

Here's your download: **[DOWNLOAD {{PDFName}}](link)**

**Quick start:** Jump to {{QuickStartPage}} first. It's the most actionable section and takes 2 minutes to read.

{{IF Transparency Checklist}}
Start with Question #3 — it's the one that reveals the most about any provider in the shortest time.
{{/IF}}

{{IF Ethical Planning Guide}}
Start with Chapter 4 (Due Diligence Checklist). It's 20 questions you can use in your next vendor meeting.
{{/IF}}

{{IF Impact Report}}
Start with the Financial Transparency section. The "72% stays in Kenya" breakdown is the number most schools ask about first.
{{/IF}}

Over the next two weeks, I'll send a few emails expanding on the ideas in the {{PDFShortName}}. Practical stuff — no fluff.

— Matthew

P.S. If you have questions about anything in the guide, hit reply. I read every one.

### Email 2: Why This Exists

**Send:** Day 3
**Subject:** Why I wrote this (and almost didn't publish it)
**Preview:** It's not exactly good for business to arm schools with hard questions

I almost didn't publish the {{PDFShortName}}.

Here's why: it arms schools with exactly the questions that make most trip providers uncomfortable. Including, honestly, some questions that make *us* work harder.

But that's the point.

The school trip industry has operated without transparency for decades. Pricing is hidden. Impact is unmeasured. Communities are used as backdrops for student photos.

If giving schools better questions means some providers lose business — good. The ones doing real work will welcome the scrutiny.

We built Kapes to be the kind of organization that benefits from transparency, not one that hides from it. Every question in that {{PDFShortName}} is one we answer openly.

If you've had a chance to use it, I'd love to hear what you found. Hit reply.

— Matthew

---

### Email 3: The Deeper Problem

**Send:** Day 6
**Subject:** The thing the {{PDFShortName}} doesn't say directly
**Preview:** Because some things need context

The {{PDFShortName}} gives you frameworks and questions. But here's the thing it doesn't say directly:

**The problem isn't bad intentions. It's bad structure.**

Most trip providers genuinely want to help. Most schools genuinely want impact. Most students genuinely want to contribute.

But the structure of the industry — short trips, project-for-visitors design, seasonal operations, pricing opacity — makes genuine impact nearly impossible, no matter how good the intentions.

That's why asking better questions matters. Not because providers are evil, but because the default model doesn't work for communities. And without pressure from schools asking the right questions, it won't change.

The schools that push hardest on transparency, continuity, and community ownership are the ones that end up with partnerships that actually deliver.

Your {{PDFShortName}} has the questions. The next step is asking them — of your current provider, your next provider, or us.

— Matthew

---

### Email 4: What We Built Instead

**Send:** Day 10
**Subject:** How we answer the hard questions
**Preview:** Since we're the ones who wrote them

Fair question: if we wrote the hard questions, how do we answer them ourselves?

**"What happens when students leave?"**
Our Seeds2Education gardens feed 200+ children daily, year-round. Water cooperatives operate 365 days. Community staff are paid monthly, not seasonally. Student visits are scheduled windows into continuous work.

**"Where does the money go?"**
72% of revenue stays in Kenya. We share line-item budgets before you book. Not estimates — line items.

**"Who's actually leading?"**
Kenyan teams. Our community staff, local rangers, and program coordinators run the programs. Students join their work. Not the other way around.

**"Can we talk to the community?"**
Yes. We connect schools with local leaders, not just past clients.

We don't claim to be perfect. We do claim to be transparent.

If you want to see how this works in practice — or ask your own hard questions — our Kenya team is available for a 20-minute call. No commitment.

**[BOOK A CALL](calendly link)**

— Matthew

### Email 5: Next Step

**Send:** Day 14
**Subject:** Two ways to go deeper
**Preview:** Whichever fits where you are right now

{{Name}},

You downloaded the {{PDFShortName}} two weeks ago. Hopefully it's been useful.

Two options depending on where you are:

**Option 1: You're still researching.**
Take our free Impact Scorecard — it's a 5-minute quiz that scores your current trip program across 5 dimensions. Hundreds of schools have used it to identify exactly where their programs have gaps.

**[TAKE THE SCORECARD](/scorecard)**

**Option 2: You're ready to explore a partnership.**
Book a 20-minute call with our Kenya team. We'll talk about your school, your students, and what a trip with Kapes would actually look like. No deck. No pitch. Just a conversation.

**[BOOK A CALL](calendly link)**

Either way, I'll keep sending occasional emails with insights on ethical school travel. Reply anytime.

— Matthew

P.S. If you found the {{PDFShortName}} useful, feel free to share it with colleagues. The more schools asking better questions, the better for everyone — especially communities.

## Sequence 3: General Welcome / Nurture (Ongoing)

**Trigger:** After Sequence 1 or 2 completes without a Calendly booking
**Frequency:** Every 2 weeks
**Goal:** Stay top-of-mind, build ongoing trust, create future booking opportunities
**Format:** Value-first emails that position Kapes as the authority on ethical school travel

### Ongoing Email Topics (Rotating)

These are not a fixed sequence — they're a library of emails sent on a 2-week cadence. Each stands alone. Mix and match based on what's most relevant.

---

### Nurture Email A: The Seasonal Angle

**Subject:** What's happening in Kenya this month
**Preview:** A quick update from the ground

{{Name}},

Quick update from Kenya:

{{Seasonal content — rotate monthly. Examples:}}

**January:** "New term just started. Seeds2Education gardens at 3 new schools are feeding their first students this week. Here's what that looks like: [photo]"

**March:** "Rainy season means our water cooperatives are at peak collection. The women running these programs just expanded to two new sites."

**June:** "Summer groups are arriving this month. But the gardens they'll visit have been feeding children since September."

**September:** "New school year. 200+ children walking into schools with lunch programs that didn't exist two years ago."

These aren't trip updates. They're program updates. The work continues regardless of who's visiting.

— Matthew

---

### Nurture Email B: The Educator Insight

**Subject:** What teachers tell us after Kenya
**Preview:** The reflection that surprised us most

The most common thing teachers say after a Kapes trip isn't about the safari. It isn't about the service projects.

It's this: **"My students stopped talking about helping and started talking about learning."**

That shift — from savior to student — is the whole point.

It doesn't happen by accident. It happens because of pre-trip curriculum that sets the right frame, because Kenyan teams lead every program, and because students join existing work instead of creating projects for show.

If you're planning a trip for next year and want curriculum integration built in from the start, that's what our educator partnerships are designed for.

— Matthew

---

### Nurture Email C: The Data Email

**Subject:** Our numbers (all of them)
**Preview:** Because trip providers should show their work

Here are our numbers. Not the curated highlights — all of them.

- **200+** children fed daily through Seeds2Education
- **365** days a year our programs operate
- **50+** women in water cooperatives
- **8** school gardens established
- **72%** of revenue stays in Kenya
- **15+** partner schools
- **100%** Kenyan-led on the ground

We publish these because we believe trip providers should show their work. Our full 2025 Impact Report breaks down every program, every number, and every goal for next year.

**[READ THE IMPACT REPORT](/resources/impact-report)**

— Matthew

---

### Nurture Email D: The Parent Angle

**Subject:** How to explain this trip to parents
**Preview:** The 3 questions every parent asks (and how to answer them)

If you're trying to get parent buy-in for an ethical school trip, you'll hear three questions:

**1. "Is it safe?"**
We share our full risk management plan, health protocols, and emergency procedures with parents before booking. Not a summary — the actual documents. 24/7 local staff. Rangers on every excursion.

**2. "Is it worth the money?"**
We share line-item budgets. Parents see exactly where their money goes. 72% stays in Kenya. No hidden fees.

**3. "Is this voluntourism?"**
This is the one parents are increasingly asking. The answer: your students join year-round programs led by Kenyan teams. They learn alongside communities, not "help" them. The work existed before the visit and continues after.

If you need help making the case to parents or administration, our Ethical Planning Guide has a full chapter on this (Chapter 8).

**[GET THE PLANNING GUIDE](/resources/ethical-planning-guide)**

— Matthew

---

### Nurture Email E: The Comparison Email

**Subject:** How to evaluate any trip provider (including us)
**Preview:** 7 questions that separate real impact from marketing

Before you book any school trip — with us or anyone else — ask these 7 questions:

1. Can you share a line-item budget before we commit?
2. What happens to the project when our students leave?
3. Are local community members paid and in leadership roles?
4. Can we speak to a community leader, not just a past client?
5. What percentage of our trip cost reaches the community?
6. Do you publish impact data for the community, not just student testimonials?
7. What does your organization do between student visits?

Any provider doing genuine work will welcome these questions. If they don't, that tells you something.

We publish our answers to all 7 in the Transparency Checklist. Grab it here if you haven't already.

**[GET THE CHECKLIST](/resources/transparency-checklist)**

— Matthew

---

### Nurture Email F: Re-engagement (for 30+ days inactive)

**Subject:** Still thinking about school trips?
**Preview:** No pressure — just checking in

{{Name}},

You downloaded our {{resource}} a while back. No idea where you are in the planning process — maybe it's not the right time, maybe you've already booked with someone else, maybe it's sitting in a tab you keep meaning to get back to.

All fine.

If school travel is still on your radar for this year or next, two things that might help:

1. **Impact Scorecard** — 5-minute quiz that scores your current program. Useful even if you're not looking at Kapes. **[TAKE IT](/scorecard)**

2. **20-minute call** — If you want to talk through options with someone who's not going to pitch you. **[BOOK HERE](calendly link)**

If neither is relevant right now, no worries. I'll keep sending occasional updates from Kenya. Reply anytime.

— Matthew

## Implementation Notes

### Email Platform Setup

These sequences are designed to be loaded into any email marketing platform (Mailchimp, ConvertKit, ActiveCampaign, etc.). Key configuration:

1. **Segmentation tags:**
   - `scorecard-complete` — triggers Sequence 1
   - `pdf-download-checklist` — triggers Sequence 2 (checklist variant)
   - `pdf-download-guide` — triggers Sequence 2 (guide variant)
   - `pdf-download-report` — triggers Sequence 2 (report variant)
   - `nurture` — triggers Sequence 3 (after Sequence 1 or 2 completes)
   - `booked-call` — removes from all sequences (goal reached)

2. **Merge fields needed:**
   - `{{Name}}` — first name
   - `{{School}}` — school name
   - `{{Score}}` — scorecard score
   - `{{Category}}` — scorecard category
   - `{{PDFName}}` — full PDF name
   - `{{PDFShortName}}` — short PDF name (checklist / guide / report)

3. **Exit conditions:**
   - Books a Calendly call → exit all sequences, tag as `booked-call`
   - Unsubscribes → exit all sequences (obviously)
   - Completes Sequence 1 or 2 without booking → enter Sequence 3 (nurture)

4. **Send times:**
   - B2B: Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11am recipient's local time
   - Avoid Monday morning and Friday afternoon

### Linking to Lead Magnets (Cross-Promotion)

Each sequence naturally promotes the other lead magnets:
- Scorecard sequence → mentions Transparency Checklist (Email 4 P.S.)
- PDF sequence → mentions Scorecard (Email 5)
- Nurture → rotates all resources

This creates multiple touchpoints and entry paths into the funnel.
