# Kapes Adventures — Traffic Strategy: Programmatic SEO + Ad Strategy

---

## Part 1: Programmatic SEO — Local Market Landing Pages

### The Opportunity

Nobody in the ethical school trip space is running programmatic SEO. Competitors either have generic "school trips to Kenya" pages (no location modifier) or hand-built destination pages. Zero competitors target queries like "ethical school trips to Kenya from London" or "service learning trips to Kenya from California."

This is a blue-ocean keyword cluster. Low volume per page, but high intent and zero competition — which means page 1 rankings with minimal effort.

**The play:** Build 60-80 templated landing pages targeting `[trip type] + to Kenya + from [location]` queries. Each page is unique enough to rank, structured enough to scale, and funnels into the scorecard.

### Market Priority (by demand + opportunity)

| Priority | Market | Est. Monthly Searches (cluster) | Competition | Terminology |
|----------|--------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | **UK** | Highest (largest school trip market globally) | Moderate but no ethical framing | "school trip," "school expedition" |
| 2 | **US** | High (280K+ students abroad annually) | Moderate, aggregator-dominated | "service learning trip," "educational tour" |
| 3 | **Australia** | Moderate | Low | "school trip," "service learning trip" |
| 4 | **UAE** | Low but zero competition | None | "school trip," "educational tour" |
| 5 | **Singapore / HK** | Low but zero competition | None | "school trip," "educational tour" |
| 6 | **Canada / Ireland / NZ** | Small but relevant | Very low | Mix of UK/US terminology |

**Creative direction:**

**Ad 1 — The Mirror Test (Contrarian opening):**
```
Most school trips are designed for the student.
Not the community.

We built a free 5-minute assessment that scores your school's
trip programme across 5 dimensions:

→ Community continuity
→ Financial transparency
→ Local leadership
→ Curriculum integration
→ Measured outcomes

67% of schools score "Room to Grow" or below.

Where does yours land?

[Take the Free Assessment →]
```

**Ad 2 — The Stat Hook (Specificity):**
```
70% of tourism revenue never reaches local communities.

If your school runs trips to Africa, that number should
bother you.

We built a free Impact Scorecard — 20 questions, 5 minutes,
honest answers only.

Most schools discover gaps they didn't know existed.

[Score My School's Trip Programme →]
```

**Ad 3 — The Enemy (Anti-Voluntourism):**
```
Your students don't need to save Africa.
Africa has something to teach them.

The voluntourism model is broken:
— Projects built for visitors, not communities
— Impact that stops when the bus leaves
— No transparency on where money goes

There's a different model.

Kapes runs year-round programmes in Kenya. Your students
join work that's already changing communities.

Start with the free Impact Scorecard.

```

**Ad 4 — Social Proof (for retargeting):**
```
"We thought our trips were making a difference. The Scorecard
showed us what we were actually missing."

— Head of Service Learning, International School

Your school trip programme. 5 minutes. 5 dimensions.
Honest results.
