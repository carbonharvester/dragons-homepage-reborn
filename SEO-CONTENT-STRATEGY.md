# How to Plan an Ethical School Trip (Without the Voluntourism Baggage)

Most school trips to developing countries follow the same pattern: students fly in, paint a wall or plant a tree, take photos, fly home, write a reflection essay about how "grateful" they are.

The school calls it service learning. The brochure says "life-changing." And everyone involved has good intentions.

But here's the problem: good intentions don't equal good outcomes. Research consistently shows that short-term volunteer trips can actually harm the communities they claim to help — creating dependency, undermining local workers, and centering the visitor experience over community needs.

This guide is different. It's written by people who run year-round community programs in Kenya — feeding schools, building water infrastructure, supporting women's cooperatives — 365 days a year. We've seen what works and what doesn't. Not from theory. From the ground.

If your school is planning an international trip and you want it to actually benefit the community you're visiting, here's how.

## The Voluntourism Problem (And Why Good Schools Fall Into It)

The voluntourism industry is worth an estimated $173 billion globally. It runs almost entirely on good intentions paired with poor structure.

Here's what typically happens:

A trip company designs a "service project" specifically for visiting students. A school somewhere gets painted. A garden gets planted. Students feel moved. Parents see photos. The school markets it as global citizenship.

Then the students leave. The project stops. Next month, another group arrives. The same wall gets painted again.

This isn't hypothetical. Studies from organizations like Learning Service and Pippa Biddle's research have documented this pattern across dozens of countries. Solar panels installed by untrained volunteers don't improve grades. Libraries built without teachers don't improve literacy. Schools constructed without community input sit empty.

The problem isn't malice. It's structure. When trips are designed for visitors rather than communities, communities become backdrops — performing gratitude for groups that will never return.

**What this looks like in practice:**

- Projects that exist only when student groups are present
- Local community members positioned as recipients, not leaders
- No measurement of community outcomes (only student satisfaction surveys)
- International staff leading programs, locals in supporting roles
- Trip costs going primarily to Western operators, not local economies

If any of this sounds familiar, you're not alone. Most schools don't know to look for these patterns because the industry doesn't encourage the questions.

## Six Principles of Ethical School Travel

After years of running programs in Kenya, working with partner schools, and learning from the communities we serve, these are the principles that separate ethical trips from voluntourism with better marketing.

### 1. The Work Happens Year-Round — Not Just When Students Visit

This is the single most important test.

If a program only operates when visiting groups are present, it was designed for visitors. Full stop.

Ethical programs run year-round with local staff. Student visits plug into work that's already happening. The trip is a window into continuous impact, not the impact itself.

**The test:** Ask your trip provider what happens during months when no student groups visit. Ask for a photo or update from an off-season month. If they can't provide one, that tells you everything.

At Kapes, our Seeds2Education gardens feed 200+ children daily, every day. Our water cooperatives operate year-round. Student visits happen during scheduled windows — the work never pauses.

### 2. Local Communities Lead — Students Learn Alongside

The default model puts international staff in charge. Local people are assistants, translators, or photo subjects.

Flip it.

In an ethical model, community members are the experts. They design the program priorities. They lead the learning. Students arrive as learners, not helpers.

This isn't just more respectful — it produces better educational outcomes. Students learn more when they're taught by people who live the context, not by Western guides interpreting it.

**The test:** Ask who designs the program content. Ask who leads on the ground. If the answer is "our international team," ask why local experts aren't leading in their own community.

### 3. Money Stays in the Community

Here's a number most trip providers won't share: what percentage of your trip fee actually reaches the local community?

Industry estimates suggest 70% or more of tourism revenue leaves the communities visited. It goes to international operators, Western staff, marketing budgets, and overhead in other countries.

Ethical providers are transparent about this. They share line-item budgets. They hire locally. They pay community staff year-round, not seasonally.

**The test:** Ask for a budget breakdown before you commit. Not a range — actual line items. If a provider won't share where your money goes, ask yourself why.

At Kapes, 72% of revenue stays in Kenya. We share line-item budgets before schools book. Every school knows exactly where their money goes.

### 4. Impact Is Measured for Communities — Not Just Students

"97% of students said it was life-changing" is not an impact metric. It's a satisfaction survey.

Ethical programs measure what changes for the community: meals served, water access improved, school enrollment sustained, women's income generated. And they publish this data, not just share it in marketing materials.

**The test:** Ask your trip provider for community outcome data. Not testimonials from past student groups — data on what changed for the people who live there.

### 5. Pre-Trip Preparation Is Curriculum, Not Logistics

Ethical travel starts before the flight. Students need context: the history, politics, economics, and culture of where they're going. They need to interrogate their own assumptions about "helping." They need frameworks for processing what they'll experience.

A packing list and a liability waiver aren't preparation. A pre-trip curriculum that includes power dynamics, colonial history, and ethical photography — that's preparation.

**The test:** Does your trip provider offer pre-trip curriculum modules? Do they address voluntourism, white saviorism, and ethical engagement directly? Or do they skip to the adventure itinerary?

### 6. Post-Trip Reflection Goes Beyond "What I Learned"

The reflection essay is a staple of school trips. But "I learned to be grateful for what I have" is not reflection — it's the poverty tourism response.

Good post-trip processing helps students connect their experience to systems: global food security, water access, gender equity, sustainable development. It channels emotions into understanding, not just gratitude.

**The test:** Does your provider offer structured post-trip reflection frameworks? Do they help students move from personal emotion to systemic understanding?

## A Practical Checklist for School Decision-Makers

Before you book your next school trip, ask these questions. Any provider doing genuine work will welcome them.

1. **What happens to the project when our students leave?** (Year-round or visit-dependent?)
2. **Can you share a line-item budget?** (Where does the money actually go?)
3. **Are local community members paid and in leadership roles?** (Who's really in charge?)
4. **Can we speak to a community leader, not just a past school client?** (What does the community think?)
5. **What community outcomes do you measure?** (Not student satisfaction — community data)
6. **What pre-trip curriculum do you offer?** (Beyond logistics and packing lists)
7. **What does your organization do between student visits?** (The year-round test)

We built a downloadable version of this checklist with "good answers" and "red flags" for each question. It's free.

## How to Get Started

If you're planning a school trip and want to do it right, here's where to start:

**If you're still researching:** Download our [Ethical School Trip Planning Guide](/resources/ethical-planning-guide) — 8 chapters covering everything from partner due diligence to making the case to parents.

**If you want to evaluate your current program:** Take the [Impact Scorecard](/scorecard) — a free 5-minute assessment that scores your trips across 5 dimensions.

**If you're ready to explore a partnership:** [Talk to our Kenya team](calendly link) — a 20-minute conversation about what's possible for your school. No pitch. Just information.

The bar for ethical school travel isn't impossibly high. It just requires asking the right questions — and choosing providers who welcome them.

## FAQ

### What is voluntourism and why is it harmful?
Voluntourism refers to short-term volunteer trips where visitors perform tasks — building, painting, teaching — that local workers could do better. Research shows it can undermine local economies, create dependency, center visitor emotions over community needs, and produce no lasting benefit for communities. The key issue is structural: programs designed for visitors rather than communities.

### How do I know if a school trip provider is ethical?
Ask three questions: (1) What happens when students leave — does the work continue year-round? (2) Can you share a line-item budget showing where money goes? (3) Are local community members in paid leadership roles? Ethical providers welcome these questions. Evasive answers are red flags.

### What's the difference between service learning and voluntourism?
Service learning integrates community engagement with academic curriculum and structured reflection. Voluntourism is typically short-term volunteer work without curriculum integration or community-defined goals. However, the label matters less than the structure — some programs called "service learning" are functionally voluntourism if they're designed for visitors, not communities.

### Can a short school trip actually make a difference?
A single 1-2 week trip by itself rarely creates lasting community impact. But a trip that plugs into year-round programs — where the community benefit doesn't depend on visitors — can be both meaningful for students and supportive for communities. The key is whether the trip amplifies existing work or creates temporary projects.

### How do I justify an ethical school trip to parents and administration?
Focus on three things: (1) curriculum integration and measurable learning outcomes, (2) financial transparency showing where money goes, and (3) evidence of year-round community impact. Our [Ethical Planning Guide](/resources/ethical-planning-guide) includes a full chapter on making the case to stakeholders.

# Voluntourism vs Service Learning: How to Tell the Difference (And Why It Matters for Your School)

Your school probably calls its international trips "service learning." So does every other school.

But here's the uncomfortable question: is your trip actually service learning, or is it voluntourism with a curriculum guide stapled on?

The difference matters. Not just ethically — though that matters plenty — but practically. Schools are increasingly being called out by parents, students, and media for trips that look more like poverty tourism than education. The IB is tightening CAS criteria. Accreditation bodies are asking harder questions.

And communities in Kenya, Ghana, Cambodia, and dozens of other destinations are tired of being the stage set for someone else's personal growth narrative.

This is how to tell which category your trip falls into. And what to do about it.

## The Quick Test

Answer these honestly:

| Question | Voluntourism | Service Learning |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Who designed the project? | Trip company (for visitors) | Community (for community goals) |
| What happens when students leave? | Project stops | Work continues year-round |
| Who leads on the ground? | International staff | Local community members |
| What's measured? | Student satisfaction | Community outcomes |
| Could locals do this work? | Yes, usually better | Students join existing expertise |
| Does the school pay for transparency? | Budget is hidden | Line-item budget shared |

If you answered "voluntourism" to three or more questions, your trip probably is — regardless of what the brochure says.

## What Voluntourism Actually Looks Like

Voluntourism isn't always obvious. It doesn't always look like teenagers building a school they're unqualified to build. The modern version is subtler.

**The "service day" add-on.** A safari or adventure trip with a half-day "community visit" tacked on. Students interact briefly with a village, take photos, leave a donation, move on. The community receives almost nothing lasting. The school markets it as service learning.

**The rotating project.** A wall gets painted. A garden gets planted. A classroom gets "built." Next month, a different group arrives. Same wall. Same garden. The project exists to give visitors something to do.

**The orphanage visit.** Still happening, despite years of research showing orphanage tourism actively harms children. UNICEF estimates 80% of children in orphanages worldwide are not orphans — they're placed there to attract tourist donations.

**The skilled task given to unskilled visitors.** Students with no construction experience building structures. Students with no teaching qualifications "teaching" English. Students with no medical training doing health screenings. In every case, local professionals exist who could do this better — and would be employed if the trip money funded their work instead.

**The emotional extraction.** Programs designed to maximize emotional impact on visitors: heartbreaking stories, grateful children, dramatic before-and-after. The community performs poverty. Students perform compassion. Nobody's situation actually changes.

## What Real Service Learning Looks Like

Genuine service learning has specific characteristics that voluntourism cannot replicate because they require structural commitments, not just better marketing.

**Year-round programs that exist independent of visits.** The community work happens every day. Student groups visit during scheduled windows and participate in what's already underway. The acid test: would this program survive if no student group ever visited again?

**Community-defined priorities.** Local leaders decide what work matters. Not the trip company. Not the school. Communities have agency over their own development. Students join a community's agenda, not the other way around.

**Local leadership on the ground.** The people who live there lead the programs. Kenyan staff run operations in Kenya. Cambodian staff run operations in Cambodia. International coordination happens, but authority lives locally.

**Curriculum integration before, during, and after.** Pre-trip modules that address power dynamics, colonial history, and ethical engagement. On-ground learning led by community experts. Post-trip reflection that moves beyond "I'm grateful" to systemic understanding.

**Financial transparency.** Schools know where their money goes. Line-item budgets are shared. A majority of trip costs stay in the local economy. Community staff are paid year-round, not seasonally.

**Measured community outcomes.** Not "97% of students said life-changing." Instead: meals served daily, water access points built, women's cooperative income generated, school enrollment rates. Published data, not marketing claims.

## Why This Distinction Matters Now

Three things are changing that make this urgent for schools:

**1. Students are more informed.** Gen Z has grown up with social media criticism of voluntourism. They've read the articles. They've seen the TikToks calling out white saviorism. Sending them on an unexamined trip risks backlash from the students themselves.

**2. Parents are asking harder questions.** "Where does our $5,000 go?" is a question more parents are asking. They've seen the investigations. They want transparency, not brochures.

**3. Accreditation and IB criteria are tightening.** CAS requirements increasingly emphasize community benefit, not just student reflection. Schools need to demonstrate genuine impact, not just intent.

## What To Do If Your Trip Is Closer to Voluntourism

Don't cancel it. Fix it.

**Step 1: Ask the hard questions.** Use a structured checklist to evaluate your current provider. We built one — 7 questions with "good answer" and "red flag" benchmarks for each.

**[Download the Transparency Checklist →](/resources/transparency-checklist)**

**Step 2: Evaluate the structure, not just the marketing.** Does the work continue year-round? Are locals leading? Where does the money go? These are structural questions, not cosmetic ones.

**Step 3: Talk to the community, not just past clients.** References from other schools tell you about the student experience. Conversations with community leaders tell you about the community impact. Both matter. Most providers only offer the first.

**Step 4: Consider a different model.** If your current provider can't answer the structural questions, it may be time to find one that can. Community-based models with year-round programs exist — they're just not the loudest voices in the market.

**If you want to benchmark your current program:** Our free [Impact Scorecard](/scorecard) scores your trips across 5 dimensions in 5 minutes. Hundreds of schools have used it.

## FAQ

### Is all voluntourism bad?
The issue isn't volunteering abroad — it's the structure. Programs designed for visitors, that stop when visitors leave, and that put unskilled people in roles locals could fill better — those cause harm regardless of intent. Programs with year-round operations, community leadership, and measured outcomes are a different category entirely.

### My school's trip provider says they're "community-based." How do I verify?
Ask for specifics: Who are the community partners? Can you talk to them directly? What happens between student visits? What community outcome data do you publish? Genuine community-based providers will answer these readily. Evasive responses are a signal.

### Can voluntourism be reformed or should schools stop going?
Schools should keep going — but differently. The answer isn't to stop engaging with global communities. It's to engage in ways that center community benefit, maintain local leadership, and demonstrate measurable outcomes. This requires choosing providers built for this model, not trying to reform providers built for the old one.

# 7 Questions to Ask Before Booking Your Next School Trip

You're about to spend $3,000-5,000 per student on an international school trip. That's $60,000-150,000+ of parent money, school time, and institutional reputation.

Before you book, ask these seven questions. They won't appear on any provider's FAQ page — and the answers will tell you more than any brochure ever could.

## 1. What happens to the project when our students leave?

This is the most important question on this list. And the one most trip providers hope you never ask.

**Good answer:** "Our programs run year-round with local staff. Student groups visit during scheduled windows and join work that's already happening. Here's a photo from last month — no visiting group was there."

**Red flag:** "We work with local partners who continue the project..." (vague, no specifics). Or: "Each group builds on what the previous group started" (means the project exists for visitors).

**Why it matters:** If the work only happens when students are present, it was designed for students, not communities. The community is a backdrop.

## 2. Can you share a line-item budget for this trip?

Not a price range. Not "approximately." A line-item breakdown showing where every dollar goes.

**Good answer:** "Absolutely. Here's our standard breakdown: X% accommodation, X% transport, X% community programs, X% local staff, X% operator margin. We'll customise it for your group size."

**Red flag:** "Our pricing is competitive for the market" (doesn't answer the question). Or: "We don't break down costs that way" (why not?).

**Why it matters:** If a provider won't tell you where the money goes, parents can't make informed decisions and communities can't verify what they receive.

## 3. Are local community members paid and in leadership roles?

Not "we work with local partners." Specifically: are the people in the community being paid, and are they making decisions?

**Good answer:** "Our Kenya team of 12 are all Kenyan nationals. They're employed year-round with benefits. Community coordinators design program priorities. Here are their names and roles."

**Red flag:** "We hire local guides and translators for each visit" (seasonal, not leadership). Or: "Our experienced Western team manages the programs" (locals are props).

**Why it matters:** If the people who live there aren't leading and being paid fairly, the program serves visitors, not communities.

## 4. Can we speak to a community leader — not just a past school client?

School references tell you about the student experience. Community references tell you about the community impact. Both matter. Most providers only offer the first.

**Good answer:** "Of course. Here's the contact for [name], who leads our [program]. And [name], the head teacher at [school]. They'll give you their honest perspective."

**Red flag:** "We can connect you with several schools who've used our programme" (deflection). Or: "Our community partners prefer not to be contacted directly" (why?).

**Why it matters:** The community's perspective on a program is at least as important as a previous client's. If a provider blocks that conversation, ask why.

## 5. What percentage of our trip cost reaches the local community?

Not "we give back to communities." A number.

**Good answer:** "72% of our revenue stays in Kenya. That includes local staff salaries, community program funding, local suppliers, and accommodation run by community members. Here's the breakdown."

**Red flag:** "A portion of every trip goes to community development" (what portion?). Or: "We donate X amount per student" (a fixed donation regardless of trip cost usually means a small percentage).

**Why it matters:** The industry average for tourism revenue staying in communities is shockingly low. Knowing the number lets you compare providers honestly.

## 6. Do you publish impact data for the community — not just student testimonials?

"97% of students said it was life-changing" is a satisfaction survey, not an impact metric.

**Good answer:** "We publish an annual impact report with community-defined metrics: meals served daily, water access points built, women in cooperatives, school enrollment data. Here's the latest."

**Red flag:** "Our alumni consistently rate their experience highly" (student data, not community data). Or: "We track the impact of each group's contribution" (means impact is attributed to visits, not year-round work).

**Why it matters:** If a provider can't show what changed for the community — with data, not stories — how do they know their programs work?

## 7. What does your organisation do between student visits?

The year-round test. Simple. Devastating.

**Good answer:** "Between visits, our Kenya team runs the same programs: school feeding, water cooperatives, permaculture gardens. We can show you monthly reports. The work doesn't stop."

**Red flag:** "We use the off-season to prepare for upcoming groups" (the program is the trips). Or: "Our local partners maintain the projects" (who? how? with what funding?).

**Why it matters:** This question reveals whether you're funding year-round community work or paying for a two-week production staged for visitors.

## What To Do With These Answers

If your current provider answers all seven questions clearly and specifically — great. You've found a good partner.

If they struggle with two or more — that doesn't mean they're bad people. It means their model wasn't built for community impact. It was built for the student experience. Those are different things.

We built a downloadable version of these questions with expanded benchmarks for each. It's designed to bring to your next vendor meeting.

# What Actually Happens on a School Trip to Kenya

Most school trip websites show the highlight reel: smiling children, safari sunsets, students building things. What they don't show is what an actual day looks like, what students actually do, and what happens before and after the plane lands.

Here's the unfiltered version.

## Before the Trip: 4-8 Weeks of Preparation

The trip doesn't start at the airport. It starts in your classroom.

Our pre-trip curriculum covers:

**Context, not logistics.** Students learn about Kenya's Kasigau Corridor — one of the world's most important wildlife migration routes and home to the first carbon-neutral factory in Africa. They learn about food security, water access, gender equity, and the SDGs. They learn why these matter to the specific communities they'll visit.

**Ethical framing.** Students interrogate voluntourism, white saviorism, and the "helper" narrative before they travel. This isn't optional feel-good content — it's the framework that makes everything else meaningful.

**Practical preparation.** Yes, there's a packing list. But also: ethical photography guidelines, community interaction protocols, and frameworks for processing what they'll experience.

By the time students board the plane, they understand where they're going, why, and what their role is. They're learners joining existing work, not heroes arriving to save.

## Day 1-2: Arrival and Orientation

Students fly into Mombasa and travel to our base in the Kasigau Corridor region. The first day is deliberately slow — acclimatisation, meeting the Kenyan team who'll lead the program, and an orientation that sets the tone.

**What students don't do:** Jump straight into a "service project."

**What students do:** Meet the community staff by name. Learn about the programs from the people who run them. Understand the context before participating in anything.

This matters. In traditional voluntourism, students arrive and start "working" immediately — because the trip company needs to deliver on the promise of service hours. At Kapes, the first priority is understanding.

## Day 3-5: Seeds2Education and Community Programs

This is the core of the trip. Students work alongside Kenyan teams in our year-round programs:

**Seeds2Education gardens.** These permaculture gardens feed 200+ children daily at partner schools. They existed before the student visit and will continue after. Students join the agricultural team: planting, maintaining irrigation, harvesting. They learn about food security from the farmers who manage these gardens year-round.

**School feeding programs.** Students see the entire chain: food grown in gardens, prepared by community cooks, served to children who would otherwise go to school hungry. Hunger is the number one barrier to education in this region. Students understand that this meal program runs every school day, not just during visits.

**Water cooperatives.** Students visit women-led water cooperatives — groups of women who've organised to build and manage water infrastructure in their communities. When women have water access, girls stay in school (they're no longer walking hours to fetch it). Students learn about water access, gender equity, and community-led development from the women running it.

The consistent thread: students participate in existing work led by local experts. They don't create new projects. They don't lead. They learn alongside.

## Day 6-7: Wildlife and Conservation

Kenya isn't just community programs. It's also one of the most extraordinary wildlife ecosystems on earth.

Students experience the Kasigau Corridor — a critical wildlife migration route between Tsavo East and Tsavo West national parks. Guided by local rangers, they learn about conservation that works with communities, not against them.

This isn't a "safari add-on." It's integrated into the curriculum: conservation economics, human-wildlife coexistence, the relationship between community development and environmental protection.

Students see firsthand that conservation and community development aren't competing priorities. They're the same priority, approached from different angles.

## Day 8-9: Reflection and Synthesis

The final days are structured reflection. Not just journaling — structured frameworks that help students connect what they experienced to the bigger picture.

Students reflect on:
- What assumptions they arrived with and how those changed
- What systems (food, water, education, economics) they saw operating
- What "impact" means when the work continues without them
- How their school's partnership with Kapes contributes over time

This reflection is designed to prevent the "voluntourism response" — the Instagram post about being grateful, the essay about how poor people are happy, the reduction of complex systems to feel-good narratives.

Instead, students leave with systemic understanding. They can articulate why food security matters for education, why water access is a gender equity issue, and why year-round programs produce different outcomes than two-week projects.

## After the Trip: What Continues

Here's what happens when your students leave:

- The gardens keep feeding children. Every school day.
- The water cooperatives keep operating. Year-round.
- The community staff keep working. Same jobs. Same pay.
- New partner schools get added to the program.
- Your school receives a post-trip impact report showing what your group's visit contributed to.

Student visits generate revenue that funds the year-round work. But the work doesn't depend on visits to exist.

Schools that return for a second year don't repeat the same trip. The curriculum evolves. The relationship deepens. That's the difference between a trip and a partnership.

## FAQ

### How many students can come on a trip?
Groups of 10-30 students with 2 teacher leaders. We keep groups intentionally small to maintain real relationships with communities and meaningful learning experiences.

### How long are the trips?
Standard programs are 5, 7, or 10 days. We work with schools to customize based on curriculum goals and logistics. Most first-time schools do 7 days.

### Is Kenya safe for school groups?
We share our complete risk management plan, health protocols, and emergency procedures with schools and parents before booking. We have 24/7 local staff, trained rangers on all excursions, and established relationships with local health facilities. Safety details: [Health & Safety](/health-and-safety).

### What does it cost?
Pricing depends on group size, duration, and program customization. We share line-item budgets before schools commit — not ranges, actual line items. 72% of revenue stays in Kenya. [Talk to our team](calendly link) for a specific quote.

### Can students earn academic credit or CAS hours?
Yes. Our programs integrate with IB CAS requirements, and we provide documentation for schools that need it. Pre-trip curriculum, on-ground learning, and post-trip reflection all map to CAS strands.

# Where Does Your $5,000 Per Student Actually Go? The School Trip Transparency Problem

You're paying $5,000 per student for an international school trip. That's $100,000 for a group of 20. Parents write the cheques. The school stakes its reputation. But ask where that money actually ends up, and most trip providers go quiet.

This isn't an accident. The school trip industry has operated without pricing transparency for decades — and it's communities in Kenya, Ghana, Cambodia, and dozens of other destinations that pay the price.

## The Numbers Nobody Shares

Here's what we know from industry research and our own experience operating in Kenya:

**70%+ of tourism revenue typically leaves the community visited.** It goes to international operators, Western staff, marketing budgets, flights, and overhead in other countries. The community that hosts your students, smiles for photos, and performs gratitude? They might see 10-15% of what you paid.

**Most trip providers don't publish budgets.** Ask for a line-item breakdown before booking — not a price range, an actual breakdown — and watch the response. Some will say it's "commercially sensitive." Others will say they "don't break costs down that way." Both responses mean the same thing: they don't want you to see.

**Fixed "community donations" mask the real picture.** Some providers say "$100 per student goes to community development." Sounds good until you realise that's 2% of a $5,000 trip. Where's the other 98%?

**Seasonal hiring is the norm.** Most trip companies hire local staff for the duration of visits. Between groups, those people have no income. This isn't community development — it's gig work dressed up as partnership.

## Why This Matters for Schools

This isn't just an ethical issue. It's a practical one.

**Parent trust.** When parents can see where their money goes, they're more supportive. When they can't, they're right to be skeptical. The next parent who asks "is this worth $5,000?" deserves a real answer.

**Institutional reputation.** Schools that get caught funding voluntourism face real reputational risk. Media investigations, social media criticism, student activism — the landscape has changed.

**Actual impact.** If you're spending $100,000 to send 20 students somewhere, wouldn't you want to know how much of that reaches the community? The difference between 10% and 70% staying locally is the difference between tourism and impact.

## What Transparency Looks Like

Here's what we share with every school before they book:

**Line-item budget breakdown.** Not ranges. Not estimates. Actual numbers for every cost category: accommodation, transport, meals, community program funding, local staff salaries, equipment, operator margin.

**72% stays in Kenya.** That's our number. It includes Kenyan staff salaries (year-round), local suppliers, community program funding, and locally owned accommodation. We publish it because schools should know it before deciding.

**Year-round staff costs included.** Our community coordinators, garden managers, and program staff are paid every month — not just during visit seasons. Their salaries are part of the trip cost because the trip is funding year-round work.

**Annual impact report.** We publish our [2025 Impact Report](/resources/impact-report) with full program data, financial breakdowns, and goals for the coming year. Not because we have to. Because trip providers should show their work.

## How to Demand Transparency from Any Provider

You don't need to switch providers to benefit from this. You just need to ask better questions:

1. **"Can you share a line-item budget before we commit?"** If no: that's your answer.
2. **"What percentage of our trip cost stays in the local economy?"** If they don't know the number: that's your answer.
3. **"Are local staff employed year-round or hired seasonally?"** Seasonal = the program exists for visitors.
4. **"Do you publish an annual impact or financial report?"** If not: what are they tracking?
5. **"Can I see where our specific group's money went after the trip?"** This is the gold standard. Few providers can do it.

We built a full checklist with "good answers" and "red flags" for these questions and more.

## The Bigger Picture

Pricing transparency isn't just about money. It's about power.

When schools can see where their money goes, they can choose providers that fund communities over operators. When communities can verify what they're receiving, they can hold partners accountable. When parents can see the breakdown, they can make informed decisions.

Opacity serves operators. Transparency serves communities.

If your current trip provider is transparent about pricing — great. Keep working with them. If they're not, ask yourself what they're protecting by keeping the numbers hidden.
